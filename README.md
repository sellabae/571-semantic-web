CECS571 Fundamentals of Semantic Web Technology

## Project 2. Semantic Data Generation
Visit data.gov to select 2-3 datasets of interest and write a program to convert these datasets into semantic data in .rdf or .owl format. these chosen datasets should ideally help you answer interesting questions if combined (in a subsequent project 3)
- Due: Mon. Mar 16, 2020 5pm
- [requirement details in project2.pdf](docs/Project2.pdf)

#### Consider the following questions when completing this project:
- Have you chosen an appropriate domain that offers a sufficient platform allowing you to answer complex questions in the subsequent project?
- If the semantic data you have generated is ran in Protégé, can the reasoner pick up any errors or inconsistency?
- How many different kinds of relationships are modeled in your semantic data?
- How complex is the semantic output overall?
- Can someone not involved in the design or development of your project gain a basic understanding of the various aspects of the semantic output after your presentation?
